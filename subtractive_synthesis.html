        <h1>Subtractive Synthesis</h1>

        <p>
            A very common type of synthesizer is the subtractive synthesizer.
            Subtractive synthesis basicallyl means that there is a little screamer (the oscillator) it makes a lot of
            noise.
            The job of the instrumentalist is to cut down, subtract, from that sound to form a new sound.
            On this page I am going to show a couple of features regarding this on the Deepmind 12.
        </p>

        <h2>Features on the Deepmind</h2>

            <h3>Oscillators</h3>

            <p class="intro_text">Oscillators are the things that make the noise within a synthesizer. </p>

                <p>You have two types of waves within this
                    synth. Saw waves, which you can hear through the first audio sample. And square waves, which you can
                    hear
                    through
                    the second audio sample. You can also combine these waves.</p>

                <p>The deepmind has 2 oscillators that can play over eachother. Oscillator 2 gives you among other
                    things
                    control over pitch and volume. The first oscillator doesn't have pitch or volume control directly
                    with
                    slider. The second oscillator produces a square wave.
                    The first audio clip lets you hear oscillator 1 and then oscillator 2 playing over it.

                <p>One of the two controls you have within the VCF is the frequency control. This controls at which
                    level of
                    frequency the sound gets cut.
                    In the audio sample you can here the higher frequencies going away and back again. This, I think,
                    results in
                    a sharper tone. With the frequency all the way down, it sound like you're underwater.

                    frequency. As resonance increases, the feedback increases to a point that the filter can generate a

            <p class="intro_text">Envelopes are a way of controlling the volume or certain filters within the synth.
                They are basically
                telling
                the synth how much, volume or control over other filter, it should give. The following envelopes are in
                order next to each other. All of the audio samples show control over volume, but you can also link
                envelopes
                to
                different filters.</p>

                <p>Sustain is the level the filter stays at after the decay. The sustain lasts as long as the note is
                    still
                    being pressed.</p>

                </audio>
                <p>Release decides how long it takes for a note to fade out after the key has been released. So with a
                    sustain
                    of 30 seconds, after you release the key that plays the note, the note will fade out over 30
                    seconds.

                Your browser does not support this audio file

            <p>An arpeggiator makes it so if you press multiple notes the get played after eachother, this can be in
                different patterns. But what happens a lot is just going down all the notes that are pressed, like in
                the
                audio sample, or going up all
                the notes that are pressed. The arpeggiator can be sped up or slowed down, this is also hearable in the
                audio clip.

            <h3>Low Frequency Oscillators (LFO)</h3>

                Your browser does not support this audio file
            </audio>
            <p>In my opinion maybe one of the more interesting sliders on the synth are the LFO's. As the name suggests
                they
                are oscillators. But instead of having a frequency so high it forms a tone, it's slow.
                You can connect a LFO to almost every filter (and more) within the deepmind. For example connect it to
                level
                (volume) or pitch control for a slight vibrato. In the audio clip the oscillator is between volume all
                the
                way off to all the way on. This doesn't sound that good (but I thought it was helpful to demonstrate),
                so
                usually you tune it so it's less "deep".

            <h3>Why this website?</h3>
            <p> I made this website because of a school project.
                This website is about the difference and functions between two keyboards of mine. Sometimes when I show
                them I get
                asked
                why I need two. But although they both have a keybed, they do very different things.
