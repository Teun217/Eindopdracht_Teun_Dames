        <h1>Subtractive Synthesis</h1>
        <p>
            A very common type of synthesizer is the subtractive synthesizer.
            Subtractive synthesis basicallyl means that there is a little screamer (the oscillator) it makes a lot of
            noise.
            The job of the instrumentalist is to cut down, subtract, from that sound to form a new sound.
            On this page I am going to show a couple of features regarding this on the Deepmind 12.
        </p>

        <h2>Features on the Deepmind</h2>


        <h3>Oscillator 1</h3>

        <p>Oscillators are the things that make the noise within a synthesizer. You have two types of waves (square and
            saw waves) and they
            both sound a little bit different. You can also combine these waves.</p>



        <h3>Oscillator 2</h3>

        <audio title="Saw wave" controls src="Audio/Osc_1_Saw.wav">

        <audio title="Square wave" controls src="Audio/Osc_1_Saw.wav">

        <p>The deepmind has 2 oscillators that can play over eachother. Oscillator 2 gives you among other things
            control over pitch and volume.

        <h3>Noise level</h3>

        <p>This slider regulates the volume of the noise.</p>

            <h3>Why this website?</h3>
            <p> I made this website because of a school project.
                This website is about the difference between two keyboards of mine. Sometimes when I show them I get
                asked
                why I need two. But although they at first glance look a little simular, they do completely
                different
                things.
                I also like talking about how they work.
