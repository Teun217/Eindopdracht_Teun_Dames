        <h3>What is MIDI?</h3>
        <p>MIDI stands for "Musical instrument digital interface. It is a way for the user to control other instruments
            or software.
            In my setup I use it connected to my computer. What happens is that when I press a key, or a drumpad,
            information about the velocity and pitch gets send to the computer. In my digital audio workspace (DAW for
            short) I can do stuff with this information.
            Like attach a digital sound to it. This way I can play almost any (digital) instrument I want. I just need a
            MIDI-controller
            and a computer.
        </p>


        <h3>More possibilities?</h3>
        <div class="container_midi">
            <p class="possibilities_midi">
                What is also possible with MIDI is controlling real life instruments, like the Deepmind 12. They do need
                a
                "MIDI in" port.
                Luckily my synthesizer has a port like that. The main way I use that port tho is not with my midi
                controller
                tho.
                My <a href="#">audio interface, the Scarlett 4i4</a> has a "MIDI out" port. This means that I can send
                MIDI
                information from my computer to my synthesizer.
                So what I mainly use it for is to program notes in on my computer, then send them to my synthesizer and
                then
                record that sound.
                This is handy because you can edit MIDI notes separatly, even let the computer stick them to the beat
                perfectly. So I can program in a pattern of notes that my synthesizer follows exactly and then start
                tweaking the sounds.
